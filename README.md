Go VS Code template
===

To use this as a project starting point:

1. Clone this repo
1. Edit the project name in two (2) places
   * .devcontainer/devcontianer.json name
   * .vscode/launch.json configuration.name
1. Install the Dev Containers extension in VS Code:
   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers

After these changes, you should be able to run the Dev Containers "Reopen in
Container" command to start and connect to the Dev Container in Code.

Once the container is running, use `go mod init` to get started.
